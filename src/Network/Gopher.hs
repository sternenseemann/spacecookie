= Overview

This is the main module of the spacecookie library.
It allows to write gopher applications by taking care of
handling gopher requests while leaving the application
logic to a user-supplied function.

For a small tutorial an example of a trivial pure gopher application:

@
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import "Network.Gopher"
import "Network.Gopher.Util"

cfg :: 'GopherConfig'
cfg = 'defaultConfig'
  { cServerName = "localhost"
  , cServerPort = 7000
  }

handler :: 'GopherRequest' -> 'GopherResponse'
handler request =
  case 'requestSelector' request of
    "hello" -> 'FileResponse' "Hello, stranger!"
    "" -> rootMenu
    "/" -> rootMenu
    _ -> 'ErrorResponse' "Not found"
  where rootMenu = 'MenuResponse'
          [ 'Item' 'File' "greeting" "hello" Nothing Nothing ]

main :: IO ()
main = 'runGopherPure' cfg handler
@

There are three possibilities for a 'GopherResponse':

* 'FileResponse': file type agnostic file response, takes a
  'ByteString' to support both text and binary files.
* 'MenuResponse': a gopher menu (“directory listing”) consisting of a
  list of 'GopherMenuItem's
* 'ErrorResponse': gopher way to show an error (e. g. if a file is not found).
  An 'ErrorResponse' results in a menu response with a single entry.

If you use 'runGopher', it is the same story like in the example above, but
you can do 'IO' effects. To see a more elaborate example, have a look at the
server code in this package.

--   is called syncronously.
type GopherLogHandler = GopherLogLevel -> GopherLogStr -> IO ()

-- $loggingDoc
-- #logging#
-- Logging may be enabled by providing 'GopherConfig' with an optional
-- 'GopherLogHandler' which implements processing, formatting and
-- outputting of log messages. While this requires extra work for the
-- library user it also allows the maximum freedom in used logging
-- mechanisms.
--
-- A trivial log handler could look like this:
--
-- @
-- logHandler :: 'GopherLogHandler'
-- logHandler level str = do
--   putStr $ show level ++ \": \"
--   putStrLn $ 'fromGopherLogStr' str
-- @
--
-- If you only want to log errors you can use the 'Ord' instance of
-- 'GopherLogLevel':
--
-- @
-- logHandler' :: 'GopherLogHandler'
-- logHandler' level str = when (level <= 'GopherLogLevelError')
--   $ logHandler level str
-- @
--
-- The library marks parts of 'GopherLogStr' which contain user
-- related data like IP addresses as sensitive using 'makeSensitive'.
-- If you don't want to e. g. write personal information to disk in
-- plain text, you can use 'hideSensitive' to transparently remove
-- that information. Here's a quick example in GHCi:
--
-- >>> hideSensitive $ "Look at my " <> makeSensitive "secret"
-- "Look at my [redacted]"

-- $gophermapDoc
-- Helper functions for converting 'Gophermap's into 'MenuResponse's.
-- For parsing gophermap files, refer to "Network.Gopher.Util.Gophermap".

-- $runGopherVariants
-- The @runGopher@ function variants will generally not throw exceptions,
-- but handle them somehow (usually by logging that a non-fatal exception
-- occurred) except if the exception occurrs in the setup step of
-- 'runGopherManual'.
--
-- You'll have to handle those exceptions yourself. To see which exceptions
-- can be thrown by 'runGopher' and 'runGopherPure', read the documentation
-- of 'setupGopherSocket'.

-- | Run a gopher application that may cause effects in 'IO'.
--   The application function is given the 'GopherRequest'
--   sent by the client and must produce a GopherResponse.

runGopher cfg f = runGopherManual (setupGopherSocket cfg) (pure ()) close cfg f

-- | Same as 'runGopher', but allows you to setup the 'Socket' manually
--   and calls an user provided action soon as the server is ready
--   to accept requests. When the server terminates, it calls the given
--   clean up action which must close the socket and may perform other
--   shutdown tasks (like notifying a supervisor it is stopping).
--
--   Spacecookie assumes the 'Socket' is properly set up to listen on the
--   port and host specified in the 'GopherConfig' (i. e. 'bind' and
--   'listen' have been called). This can be achieved using 'setupGopherSocket'.
--   Especially note that spacecookie does /not/ check if the listening
--   address and port of the given socket match 'cListenAddr' and
--   'cServerPort'.
--
--   This is intended for supporting systemd socket activation and storage,
--   but may also be used to support other use cases where more control is
--   necessary. Always use 'runGopher' if possible, as it offers less ways
--   of messing things up.
