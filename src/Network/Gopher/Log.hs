--   filter by log level you can use either the 'Ord'

-- @
-- 'GopherLogLevelError' < 'GopherLogLevelWarn' < 'GopherLogLevelInfo'

-- | UTF-8 encoded string which may have parts of it marked as
--   sensitive (see 'makeSensitive'). Use its 'ToGopherLogStr',
--   'Semigroup' and 'IsString' instances to construct
--   'GopherLogStr's and 'FromGopherLogStr' to convert to the
--   commonly used Haskell string types.
--
--   Note that encoding isn't checked for conversions from
--   encoding agnostic types, e.g. 'BB.ByteString'.
--   In 'FromGopherLogStr', invalid encoding is retained when converting to
--   encoding agnostic types (e.g. 'BB.ByteString'), but will be replaced by
--   replacement characters for types that enforce encoding (e.g. 'T.Text').
